The following section summarizes what HTML Semantic Elements are.

Semantic Elements in HTML are tags that provide structure and meaning.

Semantic Elements help developers to define the structure of a page in an easy way. Semantic
means 'meaning' therefore Semantic Elements are elements with a meaning. A Semantic Element
helps the developer and the browser to understand its meaning. Applying semantic elements help
to ensure our website designs are more accessible and inclusive.

There are two types of Semantic Elements:
Semantic: The following element names clearly define their content: form, img, table.
Non-semantic: These elements carry no inherent meaning, they don't define anything about their content: span and div.
