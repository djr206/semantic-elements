      <h1>The following section summarizes what HTML Semantic Elements are.</h1>
        <p>Semantic Elements in HTML are tags that provide <strong>structure</strong>
        and <strong>meaning</strong>.</p>
        <p>Semantic Elements help developers to
            define the structure of a page in an easy way. Semantic means 'meaning' therefore Semantic
            Elements are elements with a meaning. A Semantic Element helps the developer
            and the browser to understand its meaning. Applying semantic elements help to ensure our
            website designs are more accessible and inclusive.</p>
        <p>There are two types of Semantic Elements:</p>
                Semantic: The following element names clearly define their content: <mark>form, img, table</mark>.<br>
                Non-semantic: These elements carry no inherent meaning, they don't define anything
                about their content: span and div.<p>

      <h2>Below is an example of a "datalist".</h2>
        <p>I'm not 100% sure how the "datalist"  element works but I like these kind of things.
        I <em>fully expect</em> to better understand its usage as I progress thru the course.</p>
        Please Select an Element: <input type="text" list="elements" name="element" />
      <datalist id="elements">
        <option value="<li>"></option>
        <option value="<p>"></option>
        <option value="<ol>"></option>
        <option value="<ul>"></option>
      </datalist>
      <h3>Next we have an "ordered list" of elements.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>em</li>
        <li>strong</li>
        <li>section</li>
        <li>figure</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>And finally, an "unordered list" of random elements.</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>h1-h6</li>
         <li>dd</li>
         <li>dl</li>
         <li>dt</li>
         <li>pre</li>
      </ul>
